## Heads Up

If you are not me, you should not be here! Assume that everything here is wrong and that I don't know what I'm writing about, cuz I don't.
:::


## Sources

People I've learned from, books I've read, and resources on ASL and other sign languages. Some sources are marked with a :cherries: emoji. I haven't looked at those sources, probably cuz I never had access to them.

<!--
## Teachers

Some of my past and present ASL teachers.

- Jamil Haque. Levels 1--2. Great teacher! Likes basketball.
  + I think his name sign is a combination of J + basketball?
- Robert Parcells Junior. Levels 3--4. Amazing teacher! Likes the wilderness and wolves. Has broken a distressing number of bones.
  + I think his name sign is arbitrary. R moves downward cuz he's Robert Jr.
- Gabriel Silva.^[Doesn't have a bio. ] Level 5--6. I like him cuz he made the doorbell noise go away. Doesn't seem to like groupwork. Sometimes does simcom. On the Uber app.
  + His name sign reminds me of Clerc's, but with a V-handshape instead.
- Chaya Selzer. Level 6. Great teacher! Gets everyone to participate.
  + I uhhh forgot her name sign. Sorry, Chaya. :sweat_smile:
- Joey Antonio. Conversation A + Conversation Outdoors. Friendly + smiles a lot. I like them.
  + Their name sign is derived from laugh in French Sign Language. Kinda like a cross between a G- and X-handshape.

Sometimes we had substitutes.

- Robert DeMayo. Level 5. I think it's him. TBH I have trouble telling people apart.
  + His name sign is WHERE with an R as the handshape.
- April Cheng. Level 5. She was tough! She signs with her left hand, like me.
  + Her name sign is a one-handed ANGEL that then shifts into the A-handshape.

### Textbooks & Stuff

- _American Sign Language: A Teacher's Resource Text On Grammar and Culture_. By Charlotte Baker and Dennis Cokely. Published 1980.
  + Probably my favorite ASL book so far.
  + From 1980, so it's old. I think most of the stuff is still good. But I'm not qualified to say.
  + I think it was only in 1960 that ASL was recognized as a natural language, so there's a lot of "we don't understand this yet." I wish there were an updated version.
- _Sign-Me-Fine_. By Laura Greene and Eva Barash Dicker. Published 1990.
  + ASL grammar book for kids middle school--age and older.
  + Not very good, unfortunately. Don't think I understand ASL grammar more after reading this.
- The ASL App. By various Deaf signers.
  + This helped me with the numbers. There's lots of other stuff but I haven't use this app for that.
- _Barron's E-Z American Sign Language_. Third edition. By David Stewart, Elizabeth Stewart, Lisa Dimling, and Jessalyn Little.
  + This is okay. It's teaching me new words. Not sure the grammar stuff is super helpful, though.
- _Fingerspelling: Expressive & Receptive Fluency_. By Joyce Linden Groode. Published 2004. :cherries:
  + [Website's here](https://www.dawnsign.com/products/details/fingerspelling-expressive-receptive-fluency). The trailer seems very 1990s.
  + Bill Vicars [recommended an older version](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/fingerspelling/fingerspellinglexicalized.htm) of this video.

### Dictionaries

- [Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/). By Jolanta Lapiak.
  + Great ASL-English dictionary---arguably the best.
  + Has tutorials on grammar and conjunctions and stuff.
- [ASL University](https://www.lifeprint.com/), also known as Lifeprint. By William G. Vicars.
  + ASL-English dictionary with explanations of etymology and suggestions for how to memorize signs. Breaks the handshapes down which I find super useful.
  + Offers an entire ASL curriculum, which is incredible.
  + I think this was one of the first online ASL resources ever. That's really cool.
- [Spread the Sign](https://www.spreadthesign.com/en.us/search/). By Thomas Lydell.
  + Translations for multiple sign languages. Pretty neat.
- _The Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators. Published 2005.
  + Not an exceptional dictionary. Mostly cuz it's so hard to search and pics fail to capture what videos can.
  + Probably best used to remind me what signs look like. But definitely not for learning.
  + The chapter on classifiers is nice, though.
- _The Gallaudet Children's Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators. Published 2014. :cherries:
  + Looks similar to the adult dictionary, but it's more colorful, which I like. :rainbow:
  + Don't have access to it and haven't read it.
  + Has a [companion website](https://gcdasl.com/).
- _American Sign Language Handshape Dictionary_. By Richard A. Tennant and Marianne Gluszak Brown, and drawings by Valerie Nelson-Metlay.
  + Nice reverse dictionary. Helped me find INTERNET.
- [ASL Core](https://aslcore.org/). By RIT NTID.
  + Suggested signs for academic + technical topics.

### Linguistics

#### Books

- _Sign Languages: Structures and Contexts_. By Joseph C. Hill, Diane C. Lillo-Martin and Sandra K. Wood. Published 2019.
  + The first ASL book I read! Turns out that studying linguistics is not the best way to learn a language. 
  + Really good book. Some important things I learned:
    1. Sign languages (like all natural languages) consist of meaningless parts.
    2. There is a specific set of meaningless parts and those parts combine only in certain ways.
    3. In signs that use two hands, either the sign is symmetrical or the non-dominant hand is still. CAT and SALT are respective examples.
- _Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction 3e_. By Clayton Valli and Ceil Lucas. Published 2000.
  + I tried to use this book to learn ASL grammar. Not successful.
  + On the 5th edition (2011) now, but I've only read the 3rd.
  + 5e has a list of [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj06bPbAU0PqBHawkYzQR4AOQO9OInHWO) in lieu of a DVD.
- _Grammar, Gesture, and Meaning in American Sign Language_. By Scott K. Liddell. Published 2003.
  + I haven't read too far into this book. It's a lil beyond my understanding. :sweat_smile:

#### Studies

- [ASL-Lex](https://asl-lex.org/). By Naomi Caselli and others.
  + 2,723 signs are visualized in a network graph. Closeness is correlated with phonological relatedness.^[Phonology is the study of the meaningless parts of a sign. ] Node size is correlated with sign frequency.
  + I wonder why phonological relatedness was used and not semantic relatedness, which seems more useful. Like, what's the use with putting "cat" and "bat" next to each other? Or HORNY and HUNGRY?
    - Is it just easier?
    - Their [2017 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0742-0) says the following:  
    "For example, signs like PANTS, DRESS, and SKIRT are all fairly iconic and are produced with relatively common sub-lexical properties: the locations are all on the body (depicting where the clothes are worn), and recruit all four fingers fully extended."
- "How the Alphabet Came to Be Used in a Sign Language." Sign Language Studies 4, no. 1 (2003): 10â€“33. By Carol Padden and Darline Clark Gunsauls. [https://doi.org/10.1353/sls.2003.0026](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26204903).
  + Very cool! Mentions that ASL uses a lot of fingerspelling + suggests some reasons why.
  + Most fingerspelled words are nouns.

### Deaf Culture & History

- [Deaf Power](https://deafpower.me/resources/). By Christine Sun Kim and Ravi Vasavan, amongst others.
  + Resources for everything Deaf-relevant. Includes ASL resources.
- _Seeing Language in Sign: The Work of William C. Stokoe_. By Jane Maher. Published 1996.
  + Part Stokoe biography and part narrative history, with a focus on Stokoe's work on ASL linguistics and the negative reception around it.
  + Stokoe talks about learning systems theory in 1957? Way earlier than I thought systems theory originated.
- _Introduction to American Deaf Culture_. By Thomas K. Holcomb. Published 2012.
  + I like the book a lot. It reads like a mix between a textbook and a casual account.
- [Signing Black in America](https://www.talkingblackinamerica.org/signing-black-in-america/). By the Language & Life Project.
  + General documentary about Black ASL.

## Mistakes I've Made

So many. I'll try to track them here.

### Overgeneralization

This is a good one, in the sense that kids go through something similar during language acquisition.

When teaching us how to sign race, Jamil signed SOUTH ASIAN for himself. I wrongly assumed the s-handshape was correct for all cardinal directions. Robert later taught us that north is signed with the n-handshape and so forth.

### Picture & Book Reliance

Sometimes I sign things incorrectly cuz I look at still pics (or try to figure it out from words) instead of videos. Usually the handshape is right, but I do the movements wrong.


## Notes Notes Notes

Super messy. Very subject to change + full of error.

### Parts

Okay. Phonology. Signs consist of 5 parts, or parameters:^[[Handspeak: Phonology](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=97).]

1. Handshape: the shape of the hands.
2. Movement: how your hands move. For example, verbs move once and nouns twice; e.g. EAT and FOOD.
3. Location: where the hands are.
4. Palm Orientation: which way your palms are facing.
5. Non-manual Signals: consist of everything else. Facial expressions, head tilts, body movements, mouth position, and eye gaze.^[[Handspeak: Non-manual Signals](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=158).]

You combine those parts to create a sign. That sign is a morpheme, or a basic unit of meaning. It can either exist by itself or be combined with other signs to generate larger signs. For example, TEACH and PERSON combine into TEACHER.

### Vocabulary

When signing fast, that means VERY

### Sentence Formation

#### YOU ... YOU?

That expresses [the concept of "are"](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/a/are.htm)---it's a form of emphasis or formality or clarity.

### Indexing

You can do two things with indexing:

1. Use it to refer to one or more present `x, y, ... z`.^[Like a person or an object. ]
2. Use it to refer to one or more absent or hypothetical `x, y, ... z`.

The first thing is easy. The second thing I'm not so good at. _Sign-Me-Fine_ talked about it. They suggested a signer index all `x, y, ... z` and then use directional verbs between them. So

### Conjunctions

Remember that a conjunction binds two propositions together. ASL has conjunctions similar to English's and even more. In ASL, when signing a conjunction, raise yr eyebrows.

Jolanta Lapiak [has written about conjunctions](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=35).

#### In Class

In Level 4.4 we learned the following conjunctions:

- WRONG: suddenly, without warning
- HAPPEN: just learned, just like that
- DISCOVER: find out, realized
- FRUSTRATED: being stopped from
- HIT: unexpectedly, coincidence

Not sure how to best learn these. I'm worried I'll forget them. And some, like WRONG and HAPPEN, seem kinda similar.

### Receptive Skills

My weak point! Need to practice this a lot lot more than I'm doing now.

- Bill Vicar [has some tips on how to get receptive practice.](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/receptive-asl-skills-practice.htm)

### ASL-specific Words

ASL words and concepts that don't easily translate to other languages.

- Rogan Shannon and Ren Putz [talk about ASL slang and exclusive words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iRwQJh9dk).
- Bill Vicars [has a list of ASL idioms](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/idioms.htm).
- Jolanta Lapiak also [has an idioms list](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=146).
