Often I can get the gist, but the specifics are beyond me. This makes it difficult to participate in discussions.\nBill Vicar has some tips on how to get receptive practice.\n\n\nMissing Signs\nSometimes, when I watch people sign, some signs just drop out of my consciousness and I only realize that the person signed them later. I think this is just a receptive skills thing. Hopefully, more exposure and training will solve this problem.\nSimilarly, when I sign I may drop words and fail to sign them. I‚Äôm hoping this is also a skill issue, but it may be part of my general difficulty with communication.\n\n\nOvergeneralization\nThis is a good one, in the sense that kids go through something similar during language acquisition.\nWhen teaching us how to sign race, Jamil signed SOUTH ASIAN for himself. I wrongly assumed the S-handshape was correct for all cardinal directions. Robert later taught us that north is signed with the N-handshape.\n\n\nPicture & Book Reliance\nSometimes I sign things incorrectly cuz I look at still pics (or try to figure it out from words) instead of videos. Usually the handshape is right, but I do the movements wrong.\n\n\nSyntax Not Semantics\nThis is a bad one, in the sense that this generally only happens to grown-ups who learn a new language.\nI mix up words which have similar syntax, like BIRTHDAY and FAVORITE, just cuz a lot of the parameters are the same. This is bad! Like, native English speakers don‚Äôt confused ‚Äúbat‚Äù and ‚Äúcat‚Äù just cuz they sound similar. They mean very different things. BIRTHDAY and FAVORITE mean very different things, too. But I make these mistakes cuz I‚Äôm not a native ASL signer."

    "text": "Understanding the Parts of ASL\nASL phonology! Signs consist of 5 parts, or parameters:\n\nHandshape: the shape of the hands.\nMovement: how your hands move. For example, verbs move once and nouns twice; e.g.¬†EAT and FOOD.\nLocation: where the hands are.\nPalm Orientation: which way your palms are facing.\nNon-manual Signals: consist of everything else. Facial expressions, head tilts, body movements, mouth position, and eye gaze. Handspeak has a good explanation of them.\n\nYou combine those parts to create a sign. That sign is a morpheme, or a basic unit of meaning. It can either exist by itself or be combined with other signs to generate larger signs. For example, TEACH and PERSON combine into TEACHER.\nSome specifics:\n\nMovement\nSigning fast can be used to mean ‚Äúvery.‚Äù For example: signing SLOW quickly means ‚Äúvery slow.‚Äù (So does signing it slowly. So maybe not the best example.)\nMaking your movements bigger when signing can imply largeness. For example: signing FAMILY while making a very large circle means ‚Äúbig family.‚Äù\n\n\nLocation\nWhen fingerspelling, location influences loudness. Signing around shoulder height is typical. Signing above the shoulder is shouting, and signing below it is whispering."

ASL has conjunctions similar to English‚Äôs and even more. In ASL, when signing a conjunction, raise yr eyebrows.\nLet‚Äôs see. There‚Äôs a bunch:\n\nThere‚Äôs the rhetorical questions. These are used often. Maybe too often.\n\nThere‚Äôs WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY, and HOW. Those are straightforward.\nAlso REASON. And FOR-FOR, though I‚Äôm not sure when to use FOR-FOR versus FOR WHAT.\n\nIF or SUPPOSE. Begin with SUPPOSE and then pause between the propositions.\nDon‚Äôt use AND. Instead, use PLUS. Or, depending on the context, use ADD, ALSO, BOTH, WITH, or simply index.\nThere are also some conjunctions that aren‚Äôt used in English. I noticed that I don‚Äôt really use them spontaneously, nor do my classmates. Not quite sure how to resolve that. These include:\n\nWRONG: suddenly, without warning\nHAPPEN: just learned, just like that\nDISCOVER: find out, realized\nFRUSTRATED: being stopped from\nHIT: unexpectedly, coincidence\n\n\nJolanta Lapiak has written about conjunctions.\n\n\nIndexing\nYou can do two things with indexing:\n\nUse it to refer to one or more present x, y, ... z. Like a person or an object.\nUse it to refer to one or more absent or hypothetical x, y, ... z.\n\nThe first thing is easy. The second thing I‚Äôm not so good at. Sign-Me-Fine talked about it. They suggested a signer index all x, y, ... z and then use directional verbs between them. Barron‚Äôs E-Z American Sign Language instead suggests indexing when needed, which seems more natural to me.\n\n\nYOU ‚Ä¶ YOU?\nThat expresses the concept of ‚Äúare‚Äù.

    "text": "Word Order\nWord order is hard! Word order is so hard that I‚Äôve separated it from the Doing Things with Signs section, which overlaps a lot with this section.\nI‚Äôm not a native signer, which means I don‚Äôt have an intuitive sense of ASL grammar and whether a sequence of signs seems right or not. This leads to sloppy, confused, and disordered signing.\n\nTheoretical Knowledge\nSign Languages: Structures and Contexts mentions that ASL is relatively plastic, and that only VSO is illegal.\nWilliam G. Vicars calls SVO the most basic (or common) order in ASL. He also mentions that topicalization shouldn‚Äôt be overused and gives ‚ÄúSTORE I GO‚Äù as an example. Instead, ‚ÄúI GO STORE‚Äù is more common, which matches the English order of ‚ÄúI go to the store.‚Äù Garrett Bose agrees.\nWhich is to say: ASL can be shaped like English and maybe even often is. But to use the shape of English as our guide is a mistake. That makes expressing ASL awfully tricky. I haven‚Äôt figured it out yet.\n\n\nExamples\nLet‚Äôs look at some English‚Äìglossed ASL examples.\n\nI do not earn enough money ‚Äî I EARN MONEY NOT ENOUGH.\n\nBoth are SVO.\nThe difference between them is where ‚Äúnot‚Äù is. In ASL, NOT is modifying ENOUGH. In English, ‚Äúnot‚Äù is modifying ‚Äúearn enough.‚Äù\nWhat‚Äôs the fancy linguistic term for the difference? Why does it matter?\n\nI have seen this movie three times ‚Äî THIS MOVIE I FINISH WATCH THREE-TIMES.\n\nSVO versus OSV, I think.\n‚Äúhave‚Äù and FINISH are both modifying ‚Äúseen‚Äù and WATCH, respectively. So that‚Äôs the same.\n\nI will be back soon ‚Äî BACK SOON WILL.\n\nSVO versus OV. This is a pretty big difference. Not sure what to think of it."
