## Heads Up

If you are not me, you should not be here! Assume that everything is here is wrong and that I don't know what I'm writing about, cuz I don't.

## Intro

I like ASL a lot but I'm not very good at it. I'm hoping that writing document will help me learn it better.

Originally this was a vocab list---I kept forgetting words. Unfortunately I'm slow and it would take me literal days to transcribe the words and their structure, so I stopped doing that. I also read a bunch of books about ASL and wanted to keep track. And I wanted to be able to easily access the document on multiple devices. So: website!

I make a lot of mistakes and I'm wrong a lot, so hopefully this will help me keep track of those, too.

**2022-10-02**: Started `.qmd` document.

**2022-07-17**: The 203rd word was added to the vocab list. Stopped updating after that.

**2022-05-25**: Started `.txt` vocab list!

## Really Cool Things About ASL

1. The 3D structure! Verbal language is 1D + time---it's linear and can only move in one dimension. You can show things in 3D space in ASL which I really like. I'm not great at it but hopefully I'll get better at it.^[[Dragon](https://thatdeafguy.com/2012-10-18/).]

## Conjunctions

Remember that a conjunction binds two propositions together. ASL has conjunctions similar to English's and even more. In ASL, when signing a conjunction, raise yr eyebrows.

Jolanta Lapiak [has written about conjunctions](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=35).

### In Class

In Level 4.4 we learned the following conjunctions:

- WRONG: suddenly, without warning
- HAPPEN: just learned, just like that
- DISCOVER: find out, realized
- FRUSTRATED: being stopped from
- HIT: unexpectedly, coincidence

Not sure how to best learn these. I'm worried I'll forget them. And some, like WRONG and HAPPEN, seem kinda similar.

## Receptive Skills

My weak point! Need to practice this a lot lot more than I'm doing now.

- Bill Vicar [has some tips on how to get receptive practice.](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/receptive-asl-skills-practice.htm)

## ASL-specific Words

ASL words and concepts that don't easily translate to other languages.

- Rogan Shannon and Ren Putz [talk about ASL slang and exclusive words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iRwQJh9dk).
