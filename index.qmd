## About

These are some of my personal notes on sign languages. Mostly American Sign Language (ASL). If you are not me, don't use this to learn ASL. I'm wrong all the time! There are lots of Deaf ASL teachers around---learn from someone qualified like them, please. :cat2:


## My Notes

1. [American Sign Language: Resources](resources.qmd)
2. [American Sign Language: Notes](notes.qmd)
3. [Hawai ªi Sign Language: Brief Notes](hsl.qmd)


## Motivation

I like ASL a lot but I'm not very good at it. I'm hoping that keeping these notes will help me learn it better. I also have pencil-and-paper notes, but digital notes like these let me do things like link to videos.

Originally this was a vocab list. I kept forgetting words. Unfortunately I'm slow and it would take me literal days to transcribe the words and their structure, so I stopped doing that. Probably wasn't helping too much anyway. I also read a bunch of books about ASL and wanted to keep track. And I wanted to be able to easily access the document on multiple devices. So: website!

I make a lot of mistakes and I'm wrong a lot, so hopefully this will help me keep track of those, too.


<!-- ## Really Cool Things About ASL

1. The 3D structure! Verbal language is 1D + time---it's linear and can only move in one dimension. You can show things in 3D space in ASL which I really like. I'm not great at it but hopefully I'll get better at it.^[[Dragon](https://thatdeafguy.com/2012-10-18/). :dragon: ]
2. Exception: Fingerspelling is linear.
