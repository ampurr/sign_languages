## Heads Up

If you are not me, you should not be here! Assume that everything is here is wrong and that I don't know what I'm writing about, cuz I don't.

## Intro

I like ASL a lot but I'm not very good at it. I'm hoping that writing this document will help me learn it better.

Originally this was a vocab list---I kept forgetting words. Unfortunately I'm slow and it would take me literal days to transcribe the words and their structure, so I stopped doing that. I also read a bunch of books about ASL and wanted to keep track. And I wanted to be able to easily access the document on multiple devices. So: website!

I make a lot of mistakes and I'm wrong a lot, so hopefully this will help me keep track of those, too.

## Really Cool Things About ASL

1. The 3D structure! Verbal language is 1D + time---it's linear and can only move in one dimension. You can show things in 3D space in ASL which I really like. I'm not great at it but hopefully I'll get better at it.^[[Dragon](https://thatdeafguy.com/2012-10-18/). :dragon:]

## Sources

Here are some sources that I've been lucky to be taught by.

### Teachers

- Jamil Haque. Levels 1--2. Great teacher! Likes basketball.
- Robert J.^[Doesn't have a bio on the website. Why?] Levels 3--4. Amazing teacher! Likes the wilderness and wolves. Has broken a distressing number of bones.

### Books that Teach

- _American Sign Language: A Teacher's Resource
Text On Grammar and Culture_. By Charlotte Baker and Dennis Cokely. Published 1980.
  + Probably my favorite ASL book so far.
  + From 1980, so it's old. I think most of the stuff is still good. But I'm not qualified to say.
  + I think it was only in 1960 that ASL was recognized as a natural language, so there's a lot of "we don't understand this yet." I wish there were an updated version.
- _Sign-Me-Fine_. By Laura Greene and Eva Barash Dicker. Published 1990.
  + ASL grammar book for kids middle school--age and older.
  + Not very good, unfortunately. Don't think I understand ASL grammar more after reading this.

### Dictionaries

- [Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/). By Jolanta Lapiak.
  + Great ASL-English dictionary---arguably the best.
  + Has tutorials on grammar and conjunctions and stuff.
- [ASL University](https://www.lifeprint.com/), also known as Lifeprint. By William G. Vicars.
  + ASL-English dictionary with explanations of etymology and suggestions for how to memorize signs. Breaks the handshapes down which I find super useful.
  + Offers an entire ASL curriculum, which is incredible.
  + I think this was one of the first online ASL resources ever. That's really cool.
- _The Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators. Published 2005.
  + Not an exceptional dictionary. Mostly cuz it's so hard to search and pics fail to capture what videos can.
  + Probably best used to remind me what signs look like. But definitely not for learning.
  + The chapter on classifiers is nice, though.
- _The Gallaudet Children‘s Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators. Published 2014.
  + Looks similar to the adult dictionary, but it's more colorful, which I like. :rainbow:
  + Don't have access to it and haven't read it.
  + Has a [companion website](https://gcdasl.com/).

### Linguistics

- _Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction 3e_. By Clayton Valli and Ceil Lucas. Published 2000.
  + On the 5th edition (2011) now, but I've only read the 3rd.
  + 5e has a list of [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj06bPbAU0PqBHawkYzQR4AOQO9OInHWO) in lieu of a DVD.
  
### Other Sources

- _Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook_. Edited by Julie Bakken Jepsen, Goedele De Clerck,
Sam Lutalo-Kiingi, and William B. McGregor. Published 2015.
  + An encyclopedia.
  + I've only read the chapter on Inuit Uukturausingit (IUR or Inuit Sign Language).
  + No chapter on Hawaii Sign Language, though it is mentioned.


## Mistakes I've Made




## Conjunctions

Remember that a conjunction binds two propositions together. ASL has conjunctions similar to English's and even more. In ASL, when signing a conjunction, raise yr eyebrows.

Jolanta Lapiak [has written about conjunctions](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=35).

### In Class

In Level 4.4 we learned the following conjunctions:

- WRONG: suddenly, without warning
- HAPPEN: just learned, just like that
- DISCOVER: find out, realized
- FRUSTRATED: being stopped from
- HIT: unexpectedly, coincidence

Not sure how to best learn these. I'm worried I'll forget them. And some, like WRONG and HAPPEN, seem kinda similar.

## Receptive Skills

My weak point! Need to practice this a lot lot more than I'm doing now.

- Bill Vicar [has some tips on how to get receptive practice.](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/receptive-asl-skills-practice.htm)

## ASL-specific Words

ASL words and concepts that don't easily translate to other languages.

- Rogan Shannon and Ren Putz [talk about ASL slang and exclusive words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iRwQJh9dk).


## Appendix: HSL

Hawaii Sign Language (HSL), or more properly Hawaiʻi Sign Language, is a dying sign language. It was revealed as a natural language only in 2013.
