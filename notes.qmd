## Heads Up

If you are not me, you should not be here! Assume that everything here is wrong and that I don't know what I'm writing about, cuz I don't.

## Mistakes I've Made

So many. I'll try to track them here.

### Overgeneralization

This is a good one, in the sense that kids go through something similar during language acquisition.

When teaching us how to sign race, Jamil signed SOUTH ASIAN for himself. I wrongly assumed the s-handshape was correct for all cardinal directions. Robert later taught us that north is signed with the n-handshape.

### Picture & Book Reliance

Sometimes I sign things incorrectly cuz I look at still pics (or try to figure it out from words) instead of videos. Usually the handshape is right, but I do the movements wrong.

### Missing Signs

Sometimes, when I watch people sign, some signs just drop out of my consciousness and I only realize them later. 


## Notes Notes Notes

Super messy. Very subject to change + full of error.

### Parts

Okay. Phonology. Signs consist of 5 parts, or parameters:^[[Handspeak: Phonology](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=97).]

1. Handshape: the shape of the hands.
2. Movement: how your hands move. For example, verbs move once and nouns twice; e.g. EAT and FOOD.
3. Location: where the hands are.
4. Palm Orientation: which way your palms are facing.
5. Non-manual Signals: consist of everything else. Facial expressions, head tilts, body movements, mouth position, and eye gaze.^[[Handspeak: Non-manual Signals](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=158).]

You combine those parts to create a sign. That sign is a morpheme, or a basic unit of meaning. It can either exist by itself or be combined with other signs to generate larger signs. For example, TEACH and PERSON combine into TEACHER.

### Vocabulary

When signing fast, that means VERY

### Sentence Formation

#### YOU ... YOU?

That expresses [the concept of "are"](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/a/are.htm)---it's a form of emphasis or formality or clarity.

### Indexing

You can do two things with indexing:

1. Use it to refer to one or more present `x, y, ... z`.^[Like a person or an object. ]
2. Use it to refer to one or more absent or hypothetical `x, y, ... z`.

The first thing is easy. The second thing I'm not so good at. _Sign-Me-Fine_ talked about it. They suggested a signer index all `x, y, ... z` and then use directional verbs between them. So

### Conjunctions

Remember that a conjunction binds two propositions together. ASL has conjunctions similar to English's and even more. In ASL, when signing a conjunction, raise yr eyebrows.

Jolanta Lapiak [has written about conjunctions](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=35).

#### In Class

In Level 4.4 we learned the following conjunctions:

- WRONG: suddenly, without warning
- HAPPEN: just learned, just like that
- DISCOVER: find out, realized
- FRUSTRATED: being stopped from
- HIT: unexpectedly, coincidence

Not sure how to best learn these. I'm worried I'll forget them. And some, like WRONG and HAPPEN, seem kinda similar.

### Receptive Skills

My weak point! Need to practice this a lot lot more than I'm doing now.

- Bill Vicar [has some tips on how to get receptive practice.](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/receptive-asl-skills-practice.htm)

### ASL-specific Words

ASL words and concepts that don't easily translate to other languages.

- Rogan Shannon and Ren Putz [talk about ASL slang and exclusive words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iRwQJh9dk).
- Bill Vicars [has a list of ASL idioms](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/idioms.htm).
- Jolanta Lapiak also [has an idioms list](https://www.handspeak.com/learn/index.php?id=146).
