## Teachers

Some of my past and present ASL teachers.

- Jamil Haque. Levels 1--2. Great teacher! Likes basketball.
  + I think his name sign is a combination of J + basketball?
- Robert Parcells Junior. Levels 3--4. Amazing teacher! Likes the wilderness and wolves. Has broken a distressing number of bones.
  + I think his name sign is arbitrary. R moves downward cuz he's Robert Jr.
- Gabriel Silva.^[Doesn't have a bio. ] Level 5--6. I like him cuz he made the doorbell noise go away. Doesn't seem to like groupwork. Sometimes does simcom. On the Uber app.
  + His name sign reminds me of Clerc's, but with a V-handshape instead.
- Chaya Selzer. Level 6. Great teacher! Gets everyone to participate.
  + I uhhh forgot her name sign. Sorry, Chaya. :sweat_smile:
- Joey Antonio. Conversation A + Conversation Outdoors. Friendly + smiles a lot. I like them.
  + Their name sign is derived from laugh in French Sign Language. Kinda like a cross between a G- and X-handshape.

Sometimes we had substitutes.

- Robert DeMayo. Level 5. I think it's him. TBH I have trouble telling people apart.
  + His name sign is WHERE with an R as the handshape.
- April Cheng. Level 5. She was tough! She signs with her left hand, like me.
  + Her name sign is a one-handed ANGEL that then shifts into the A-handshape.
