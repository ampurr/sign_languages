Assume that everything here is wrong and that I don't know what I'm writing about, cuz I don't.\n\n\n## What are these Resources About?\n\nThese are educational, fun, or interesting resources on ASL, Deaf culture and history, and other sign languages. Sources marked with a :cherries: emoji haven't been looked at, but they're here cuz I thought they seemed useful.\n\nNote to self: remember that the best teacher is a Deaf instructor or tutor. These resources help with learning but are insufficient for getting a thorough understanding of sign languages or Deaf culture.\n\n\n## Deaf Culture & History\n\n- [Deaf Artists](https://deaf-art.org/). By RIT NTID.\n  + Lots of info on Deaf artists and art.\n- [Deaf Power](https://deafpower.me/resources/).

By Thomas K. Holcomb. Published 2012.\n  + I like the book a lot. It reads like a mix between a textbook and a casual account.\n  + Has a [companion website](http://www.introductiontodeafculture.com/intro-to-deaf-culture.html).\n- [Meeting and Interacting with Deaf People](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/meeting-deaf-people.htm). By Belinda G. Vicars.\n  + How to interact at Deaf events without seeming like a twat.\n- _Seeing Language in Sign: The Work of William C. Stokoe_. By Jane Maher. Published 1996.\n  + Part Stokoe biography and part narrative history, with a focus on Stokoe's work on ASL linguistics and the negative reception around it.\n  + Stokoe talks about learning systems theory in 1957. Way earlier than I thought systems theory originated.\n- [Signing Black in America](https://www.talkingblackinamerica.org/signing-black-in-america/). By the Language & Life Project.\n  + Documentary about Black ASL.\n\n\n## Deaf Events\n\n- [Camp Mark 7](https://www.campmark7.org/).\n  + Summer camp for Deaf in very upstate NY.\n- [Deaf Coffee](https://deafcoffee.com/).\n  + Deaf meetups around the US.\n\n\n## Dictionaries\n\n- _American Sign Language Handshape Dictionary_. By Richard A. Tennant and Marianne Gluszak Brown, and drawings by Valerie Nelson-Metlay.\n  + Nice reverse dictionary, though kinda outdated. Helped me find INTERNET.\n- [ASL Core](https://aslcore.org/). By RIT NTID.\n  + Suggested signs for academic + technical topics.\n- [ASL University](https://www.lifeprint.com/), also known as Lifeprint. By William G. Vicars.\n  + ASL-English dictionary with explanations of etymology and suggestions for how to memorize signs. Breaks the handshapes down which I find super useful.\n  + Offers an entire ASL curriculum, which is incredible.\n  + I think this was one of the first online ASL resources ever. That's really cool.\n- [Handspeak](https://www.handspeak.com/). By Jolanta Lapiak.\n  + Great ASL-English dictionary --- arguably the best.\n  + Contains an extraordinary reverse dictionary. As far as I can tell, it's the only one online. Some signs in the main dictionary are missing in the reverse dictionary.\n  + Has tutorials on grammar and conjunctions and stuff.\n- [Signing Savvy](https://www.signingsavvy.com/).

By Thomas Lydell.\n  + Translations for multiple sign languages. Pretty neat, though not super comprehensive.\n  + They have sentences, too.\n- _The Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators. Published 2005.\n  + Not an exceptional dictionary. Mostly cuz it's so hard to search and pics fail to capture what videos can.\n  + Probably best used to remind me what signs look like. But definitely not for learning.\n  + The chapter on classifiers is nice, though.\n- _The Gallaudet Children's Dictionary of American Sign Language_. By GU editors and illustrators.

By Scott K. Liddell. Published 2003.\n  + I haven't read too far into this book. It's a lil beyond my understanding. :sweat_smile:\n- _Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction_. Third edition. By Clayton Valli and Ceil Lucas. Published 2000.\n  + I tried to use this book to learn ASL grammar. Not successful.\n  + On the 5th edition (2011) now, but I've only read the 3rd.\n  + 5e has a list of [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj06bPbAU0PqBHawkYzQR4AOQO9OInHWO) in lieu of a DVD.\n- _Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook_.

By Joseph C. Hill, Diane C. Lillo-Martin and Sandra K. Wood. Published 2019.\n  + The first ASL book I read! Turns out that studying linguistics is not the best way to learn a language. \n  + Really good book. Some important things I learned:\n    1. Sign languages (like all natural languages) consist of meaningless parts.\n    2. There is a specific set of meaningless parts and those parts combine only in certain ways.\n    3. In signs that use two hands, either the sign is symmetrical or the non-dominant hand is still. CAT and SALT are respective examples.\n\n### Studies\n\n- [ASL-Lex](https://asl-lex.org/). By Naomi Caselli and others.\n  + 2,723 signs are visualized in a network graph. Closeness is correlated with phonological relatedness.^[Phonology is the study of the meaningless parts of a word or sign. ] Node size is correlated with sign frequency.\n  + It would be nice to also have a graph focused on semantic relatedness. But that's harder.\n  + Their [2017 paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-016-0742-0) says the following:  \n    \"For example, signs like PANTS, DRESS, and SKIRT are all fairly iconic and are produced with relatively common sub-lexical properties: the locations are all on the body (depicting where the clothes are worn), and recruit all four fingers fully extended.\"\n- [How the Alphabet Came to Be Used in a Sign Language](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26204903). By Carol Padden and Darline Clark Gunsauls. Published 2003. \n  + Very cool! Mentions that ASL uses a lot of fingerspelling + suggests some reasons why.\n  + Most fingerspelled words are nouns.\n\n\n## ASL Textbooks\n\n- _American Sign Language: A Teacher's Resource Text On Grammar and Culture_. By Charlotte Baker and Dennis Cokely. Published 1980.\n  + Probably my favorite ASL book so far.\n  + From 1980, so it's old. I think most of the stuff is still good. But I'm not qualified to say.\n  + ASL was recognized as a natural language only in 1960, so there's a lot of \"we don't understand this yet.\" I wish there were an updated version.\n- _Barron's E-Z American Sign Language_. Third edition. By David Stewart, Elizabeth Stewart, Lisa Dimling, and Jessalyn Little. Published 2011.\n  + This is okay. It's teaching me new words. Not sure the grammar stuff is super helpful, though.\n- _Sign-Me-Fine_. By Laura Greene and Eva Barash Dicker.
